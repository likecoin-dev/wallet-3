
Build Instructions Infinity Client v0.5.1
----------------------------------------

XIN Client makes extensive use of nodejs. We use if for dependency managemnt, to power our 
builds and to assist in development through auto-recompiling and to power up your local 
development server. Complete installation instructions for nodejs are out of the scope of 
this document since those instructions depend largely on the platform you are on.

Windows and Mac users please look at anyone of these links:

Building desktop versions
-------------------------

XIN uses Electron from Github to provide users with an installable desktop application. 
Electron and therefore XIN client works on all modern operating systems.

To build the actual desktop releases we use https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager. 
Note that you need Node.js > 4.0 to use electron-packager.

# To build a windows package
$ electron-packager ./dist --platform=win32 --arch=x64

# To build a linux package
$ electron-packager ./dist --platform=linux --arch=x64
