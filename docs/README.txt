Welcome to Infinity Economics (XIN).

This is the client reference implementation of Infinity.

We currently do our client and server development on Debian/Ubuntu desktops, we find it to be 
an excellent open source free! and secure platform. While we try and help new developers coming 
to XIN  as best as possible, it is unfortunately not possible to include detailed step by 
step instructions for platforms that are not Debian based. In time it is our goal to include 
detailed step by step instructions for all platforms. 

Want to access your crypto funds quickly but had to wait for hours while the blockchain downloads 
first? The XIN Lite Client connects to public XIN nodes to retrieve up-to-date blockchain 
information. We provide all the cryptographic tools required to create addresses, sign and verify 
transactions for the XIN blockchain. The XIN Lite Client reads all the data from the public nodes, 
creates the transaction directly in the browser, and simply broadcasts it in a finished state to
open nodes, means your seed never leaves your local box.

Using the client
------------------
The client distribution in combination with a webserver can be used as Web/Online
client. You can host your own online client by dropping the dist into your html
root folder, makes it easy for private online wallets. The desktop version comes
as platform independent electron build and works as an usual self contained executable.
Simply execute xin-client on your target machine after the build.
